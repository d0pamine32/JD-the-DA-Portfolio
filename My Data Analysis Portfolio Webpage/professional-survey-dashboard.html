                <!--Short Description about the project-->
                <p>This Power BI project analyzes a survey of data professionals, focusing on average salary by job title and gender, favorite programming languages, 
                    and satisfaction with salary and work-life balance. 
                    It also visualizes the distribution of survey participants by country, providing key insights into industry trends and global demographics. 
                    I created this project to gain a deeper understanding of trends within the data professional community, 
                    uncovering insights that could help industry professionals make informed career decisions and understand the evolving landscape of the field.<br>
                    This project was an opportunity to work on a real-world dataset with a guided approach to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the subject.

                <!--Where did the data come from?-->
                <h4>Data Source</h4>
                <p>The data used in this project was sourced from Alex the Analyst's
                    <a href="https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx" target="_blank" class="data-link">Github Repo</a>.</p>

                <!--What issues did you find in the raw data? How did you clean the data?-->
                <h4>Data Cleaning</h4>
                <p>The dataset contains several data quality issues that need to be addressed to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis. The key problems include:</p>
                <ul class="project-list">
                    <li>
                        Some columns contained no data or were entirely filled with null values, making them unnecessary for analysis.
                    </li>
                        
                    <li>
                        Respondents could type custom answers after selecting “Other,” 
                        leading to inconsistencies like "Other: Big Data" and "Other: Cloud Computing", making analysis difficult.
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        Some salary responses were given in ranges (e.g., "125k-150k" and "225+""), making numerical analysis and comparisons difficult.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>To address data quality issues, the following solutions were implemented:</p>
                <ul class="project-list">
                    <li>
                        These columns were identified and removed to keep the dataset clean and focused on relevant data.
                    </li>
                        
                    <li>
                        The answers were split using a delimiter, extracting only the relevant terms and deleting the temporary column created in the process to maintain uniformity.
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        These salary ranges were converted into their average values (e.g., "$55,000") to ensure consistency and facilitate better analysis.
                    </li>
                </ul>



                <!--What analytical methods did you apply?-->
                <h4>Data Analysis Techniques</h4>
                <p>The analysis used is <b>Descriptive Analysis</b>, which focuses on summarizing key data points such as average salary, age, work-life balance, and demographic trends. 
                    This technique is used to explain the current state of the data by highlighting important insights and metrics.</p>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Here are the key insights on salaries, skills, job satisfaction, and workforce demographics from the Data Professional Survey Breakdown:</p>
                <ul class = "project-list">
                    <li><strong>Strong Salary Growth for Data Scientists</strong>
                        <ul class = "sub-list">
                            <li><strong>Data Scientists</strong> lead in salary averages, highlighting the high demand and value placed on this role in the data field. 
                                This suggests that specializing in data science could be a lucrative career path.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                
                    <li><strong>Minimal Gender Pay Gap</strong>
                        <ul class = "sub-list">
                            <li>The <strong>small gender salary gap</strong> indicates that the data industry is making strides toward gender pay equality, though there is always room for improvement.
                                This is encouraging for promoting diversity and inclusion within the sector.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                
                    <li><strong>Dominance of Python</strong>
                        <ul class = "sub-list">
                            <li><strong>Python</strong> continues to be the most preferred programming language, reinforcing its status as the go-to language for data professionals. 
                                It also suggests that proficiency in Python remains a critical skill for data-related careers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                
                    <li><strong>Moderate Satisfaction with Salary and Work-Life Balance</strong>
                        <ul class = "sub-list">
                            <li><strong>Satisfaction with salary</strong> (4.27/10) and <strong>work-life balance</strong> (5.74/10) is notably low, pointing to potential issues in job satisfaction within the industry. 
                                Companies may need to focus on improving both compensation packages and work-life balance initiatives to attract and retain top talent.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                
                    <li><strong>Young, But Experienced Workforce</strong>
                        <ul class = "sub-list">
                            <li>The <strong>average age of 29.87</strong> suggests that the data profession is attracting younger talent who are highly skilled but also at an early stage in their careers. 
                                This could imply a dynamic and rapidly evolving workforce eager for growth and career development.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                
                    <li><strong>Global Reach of Data Professionals</strong>
                        <ul class = "sub-list">
                            <li>The <strong>geographic diversity</strong>, with a large portion of respondents from the US and India, shows that the data field is global, with professionals from various regions contributing to the industry. 
                                This indicates opportunities for collaboration across borders and a diverse range of perspectives in solving data-related challenges.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The data shows that data professionals, especially data scientists, are enjoying competitive salaries, with Python remaining the most popular programming language. 
                    However, work satisfaction, particularly regarding salary and work-life balance, could use improvement, as reflected in the relatively low satisfaction scores. 
                    The workforce is young and diverse, indicating that the field is evolving quickly. 
                    These insights are valuable for both career planning and industry strategies, highlighting strengths and areas that need attention moving forward.
