                <p>Have you ever wondered what drives customers to buy certain products or how sales trends change over time? 
                    That curiosity led me to this project. 
                    I wanted to take raw sales data and turn it into something interactive and insightful. 
                    Something that could help businesses understand their customers better and make smarter decisions.</p>

                <!--Where did the data come from?-->
                <h4>Data Source</h4>
                <p>The data used in this project was sourced from 
                    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmettahiraslan/customer-shopping-dataset" target="_blank" class="data-link">Kaggle</a>.</p>.</p>

                <!--What issues did you find in the raw data? How did you clean the data?-->
                <h4>Data Cleaning</h4>
                <p>The data was generally well-structured, with the only issue being the <b>invoice_date</b>, which had an inconsistent format and incorrect data type. 
                    To resolve this, I standardized the format to <b>MMM/DD/YYYY</b> before converting it to a date data type.</p>

                <!--What analytical methods did you apply?-->
                <h4>Data Analysis Techniques</h4>
                <p><b>Descriptive analysis</b> was used in this project to summarize key shopping trends, including total sales over time and across different locations. 
                    The dashboard also provides insights into average spending by age bracket, helping to identify customer purchasing patterns. </p>

                <!--What types of charts or dashboards did you create?-->
                <h4>Data Visualization</h4>
                <p>This interactive dashboard provides a detailed analysis of shopping trends through various visualizations. 
                    It features time series line charts to monitor sales over time and bar charts for comparing revenue across locations and spending patterns by age group. 
                    With dynamic filtering options, users can refine insights based on gender, date, purchased products, or payment methods.</p>

                <!--Conclusion Section-->
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>This customer shopping data dashboard provides key insights into sales performance, spending habits, and location-based revenue trends. 
                    By analyzing sales by category, total sales per location, and average spending by age group, 
                    businesses can better understand consumer behavior and optimize their strategies.</p>
