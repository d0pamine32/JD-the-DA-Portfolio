                <p>This exploratory data analysis (EDA) examines resource consumption, physical activity, waste management, and dietary habits to identify sustainability trends. 
                    By analyzing electricity and water usage across locations, tracking plastic disposal methods, and assessing lifestyle choices across age groups, 
                    this study provides insights into sustainable living practices and areas for improvement.

                    Here are the problems that I have solved, following some of its answers:

                <h4>Data Source</h4>
                <p>The data used in this project was sourced from 
                    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naveennas/sustainable-lifestyle-rating-dataset" target="_blank" class="data-link">Kaggle</a>.</p>

                <!--What issues did you find in the raw data? How did you clean the data?-->
                <h4>Data Cleaning</h4>
                <p>Before diving into exploratory data analysis (EDA), I ensured the dataset was clean and structured for accurate insights. The following steps were taken:</p>

                <ul class="project-list">
                    <li>
                        Checked dataset structure using <code>df.info()</code> to understand column types and detect any inconsistencies.
                        <div class="image-snippet">
                            <img src="images/lifestyle-eda-images/df_info.png" alt="Dataset structure" class="clickable-image">
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Identified missing values with <code>df.isnull().sum()</code> to determine the extent of missing data. 
                        <i>Community Involvement</i> and <i>Physical Activities</i> had null values.
                        <div class="image-snippet">
                            <img src="images/lifestyle-eda-images/check_null.png" alt="Missing values check" class="clickable-image">
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The columns <i>CommunityInvolvement</i>, <i>SustainableBrands</i>, and <i>ClothingFrequency</i> 
                        were unrelated to the key objectives of the EDA, so they were removed to maintain a focused and efficient analysis.
                        <div class="image-snippet">
                            <img src="images/lifestyle-eda-images/drop_col.png" alt="Dropped columns" class="clickable-image">
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The column <i>PhysicalActivities</i> was interesting despite having many null values, and I found it essential for the analysis. 
                        Missing values were filled with <i>Prefer not to say</i> since they likely represent respondents who chose not to disclose this information.
                        <div class="image-snippet">
                            <img src="images/lifestyle-eda-images/fill_na.png" alt="Filled missing values" class="clickable-image">

                </ul>

                
                <!--What analytical methods did you apply?-->
                <h4>Data Analysis Techniques</h4>
                <p><strong>Descriptive analysis</strong> was utilized to summarize and interpret key aspects of sustainability and lifestyle trends across various demographic groups and locations. The analysis involved:</p>
                    <ul class="project-list">
                        <li><strong>Average monthly electricity and water consumption</strong> for each location to identify regional patterns in resource usage.</li>

                        <li><strong>Count of physical activities</strong> based on gender to explore participation differences in sustainable physical practices.</li>

                        <li><strong>Frequency of plastic use</strong> and the <strong>disposal methods</strong> used for each location to evaluate sustainability practices related to waste management.</li>
                        
                        <li>Categorizing participants into <strong>age brackets</strong> (e.g., 18-26 as Adolescence) to better understand age-based trends and behaviors.</li>
                        
                        <li>Analyzing <strong>DietType</strong> based on <strong>age bracket</strong> and <strong>gender</strong> to explore how these factors influence dietary preferences related to sustainability.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>This approach provides an overall view of how different demographic variables contribute to sustainable lifestyle choices and behaviors.</p>


                <!--What types of charts or dashboards did you create?-->
                <h4>Data Visualization</h4>
                <p><p>To bring the Lifestyle Sustainability EDA to life, different visualizations were used to make the insights clear and engaging. 
                    A <b>bar graph</b> was the best fit to compare <b>resource consumption across locations</b> and <b>physical activity levels by gender</b>, 
                    giving a straightforward look at how these factors vary. Since comparing categories side by side can get messy, 
                    a <b>horizontal bar graph</b> made it easier to visualize <b>plastic usage and disposal methods per location</b>, 
                    keeping everything neat and readable. Finally, a <b>heatmap</b> was the perfect choice for showcasing <b>diet types across different age groups</b>, 
                    revealing patterns in dietary preferences at a glance. 
                    These visualizations not only make the data easier to digest but also highlight key sustainability trends that might otherwise go unnoticed.</p>
            </p>

                <!--Conclusion Section-->
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>This exploratory data analysis examines lifestyle sustainability across different demographics, focusing on resource consumption, 
                    physical activity, plastic usage, disposal methods, and diet preferences. 
                    The findings reveal how location, gender, and age influence sustainable habits.</p>

                        </ul>
                    </li>

                            <li>Suburban areas primarily use Recycling. Urban areas lean towards Composting and Landfills. 
                                Rural areas commonly use a Combination method or Landfills.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                            <li>Nearly half of middle-aged individuals follow a Plant-based diet. Seniors have an equal distribution of diet types. 
                                Young adults also have a balanced diet distribution but lean slightly toward a Balanced diet.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The analysis highlights noticeable patterns in sustainability behaviors, emphasizing the impact of environment and demographics. 
                    These insights can help guide targeted efforts to promote more sustainable practices in different communities.</p>
